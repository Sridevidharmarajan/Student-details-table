Table Structure (<table>):
The <table> element is used to structure the data into rows and columns.
It includes a header row (<tr>) with column headings (<th>) for Student ID, Name, Year, Department, Email, Contact No, Address, 10th Percentage, 12th Percentage, and GPA.
Table Data Rows (<tr>):
Each <tr> element represents a row of data for each student.
<td> elements within each <tr> define the data cells containing specific details such as student ID, name, etc.
Alignment and Styling:
The <h2> heading is centered (align="center") to highlight the title "Student Details".
Borders (border="2") are added to the table to visually separate rows and columns.# Student-details-table
